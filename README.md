# Building an Intelligent Car Recommendation System with Web Scraping, Machine Learning, and Power BI Visualization

This project delves into the exciting realm of car recommendation systems, where web scraping, machine learning (ML), and data visualization come together to empower users in making informed car purchase decisions. We'll embark on a journey that encompasses:

# Web Scraping Cars24 Data: 
Extracting relevant information from cars24.com, a leading online car marketplace in India.
# Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering: 
Preparing the scraped data for ML by cleaning, transforming, and crafting informative features.
# Machine Learning Model Selection and Training: 
Choosing the most suitable ML algorithm and training it on the prepared dataset.
# Power BI Visualization: 
Creating interactive dashboards to visually represent car recommendations and insights.
