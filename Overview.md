# I am thrilled to announce the completion of a recent project our team undertook as part of an internship at EVOASTRA VENTURES PVT LTD . , I had the pleasure of guiding our team in building a comprehensive system for scraping and analysing data from the used car market on Cars24.com . Here is a summary of our work:

# Web Scraping:
⁍ Leveraged Python, Selenium, and BeautifulSoup to handle dynamic page content.
⁍ Collected detailed data on car listings, such as brand, model, price, etc.

# Data Cleaning:
⁍ Developed custom functions to standardize data.
⁍ Managed missing entries and converted data types for smoother analysis.

# Data Visualization:
⁍ Created visualizations that highlighted car distribution by location, fuel type, and brand (Renult,Mahindra,Jeep).
⁍ Analysed price ranges and identified popular models in 11 Major cities on India.

# Key Insights:
⁍ Cars with higher mileage tend to have lower prices, indicating a negative relationship between kilometers driven and price.
⁍ The distribution of car prices is skewed towards lower values, suggesting that most cars are priced in the lower range.

This project sharpened our skills in web scraping, data manipulation, and visualization, utilizing tools like Pandas, Selenium, and BeautifulSoup. Leading the team has been an enriching experience, blending project management with collaborative problem-solving.

A big shoutout to my talented teammates! Your creativity and hard work made this project a success.
Excited to tackle more real-world challenges ahead!
